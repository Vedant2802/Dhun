        nuances and sensitivities. We use inclusive language in subtitles,
        considering diverse linguistic expressions and colloquialisms to enhance
        accessibility for all audiences. Ensuring accuracy in translating and
        transcribing spoken content to text is paramount for us. We provide
        context-aware subtitles that convey the intended meaning while avoiding
        any misrepresentation or distortion of information. Moreover, we empower
        users by providing tools to customize their subtitle preferences. Our
        commitment to accessibility is further emphasized by aligning with
        accessibility standards, ensuring the inclusivity of subtitles
